# Cowboy-Vs.-Ninja
A repo for a game I whipped up years ago. Massive memory issues, good learning experience.

## The Story
During my senior year of high school, my final project was a 2 player competitive shmup called Cowboy vs Ninja. Unfortunately I don't have any of that old c++ code. What I do have is the version I made in Java upon going back to college.

Unfortunatly I didn't manage the assets properlly and loaded in a new copy on the texture for every bullet. So this game is really, really bad.

I also would want to completly redo the architecture now that I have more xp, but it's just not a priority now.

Somee day I'll return to the idea of a 2 player fighting shoot-em-up that becomes progressivly more chaotic as the players interact; for now, may the idea not be forgotten.
